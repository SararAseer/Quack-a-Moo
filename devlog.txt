Response to reading:
  The author brings up many points that are useful to programmers
such as ourselves, which we may have already encountered or will encounter in the future.
It stresses the importance of having a cohesive teamwork environment, making sure
that everyone is on the same page to prevent chaotic programming breakages. Additionally,
it is important to thoroughly test your code to prevent unexpected errors further down
the road, which at that point, it may be harder to detect where the bug is.
Actions we will take:
  1) Stay in contact with teammates, and clearly communicate the idea
  behind the things that you change or add.
  2) Do not add to the project unless you fully understand the changes mentioned
  in the devlog.
  3) Have a clear objective behind each change you make in order to maintain
  a stable program.
